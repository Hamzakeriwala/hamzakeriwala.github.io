This project was part of the Introduction to Software engineering (CSCC01) course. We were put into a team of 5 people and had to develop a plugin for an existing software called Zotero. This plugin was based on requirements provided by a client, a professor from our university (UofT). As part of the project, we followed the AGILE software development method by creating burn down charts based on user stories and having regular meetings, etc. Eventually, we ended up developing a fine plugin that takes care of batch-editing of tags and being able to modify custom output styles. The following is our read me page for this project, from Github.
