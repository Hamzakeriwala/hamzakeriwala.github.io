This application was a project for my Introduction to Databases course (CSCC43). The purpose of this project was to develop an application, pertaining to a pizza delivery system, that provides a UI for ordering Pizzas and stores all the data in a MySQL database. A few of the objectives were as follows-
<br>- Create a relational database design for how the data will be organized
<br>-Implement the design by storing the data with the correct relations/dependencies in normalized databases
<br>-Connect the database to the UI
<br><br>
Below are a couple of screenshots for the project:<br>
